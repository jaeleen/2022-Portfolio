                        Project: Immigration platform Development
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        I worked on developing an immigration platform to simplify the application process for users seeking immigration services. My responsibilities included overseeing the design process, collaborating with an outsourced development team, and ensuring that the final product met industry standards for security and performance. 
                    </p> <br>
                    <h2>Key Responsibilities Design and Prototyping:</h2>
                    <p>	
                        I utilized Figma to create intuitive and user-friendly designs for the immigration platform. This involved developing wireframes and high-fidelity prototypes that focused on addressing user needs and showcasing the flow of the application. The design emphasized accessibility, responsiveness, and ease of use to ensure that users could navigate the platform efficiently. 
                    </p> <br>
                    <h2>
                        Outsourcing Development:
                    </h2>
                        
                    <p>
                        In this role, I identified and selected an experienced development team to bring the design to life. I managed the outsourcing process to ensure alignment with project goals and timelines, working closely with the development team to facilitate regular meetings and discuss project progress, design implementation, and any technical challenges that arose. 
                    </p>
                       
                    <h2>
                        Quality Assurance and Testing
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        To ensure the platform's security, I made sure it adhered to OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) standards. I conducted reviews and provided feedback to the development team on security best practices throughout the development process. Additionally, I utilized Cypress for end-to-end regression testing of the front-end application and employed Apache JMeter to analyze and measure the performance of the application. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        Collaboration and Communication:
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Using Git for version control, I collaborated with the development team to facilitate effective tracking of changes and updates to the codebase. I also maintained open communication with the client to gather feedback, clarify requirements, and provide updates on the project’s progress. 
                    </p> 
                    <h2>
                        Website Review and Iteration:
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        I conducted thorough reviews of the website at various stages of development, providing constructive feedback and ensuring that design elements were correctly implemented. Furthermore, I collaborated with the development team to iterate on designs based on testing results and client feedback, ensuring that the final product exceeded expectations and met all functional requirements.
                    </p>
